Learning Scala

Here are some projects to learn Scala that I came up with:

1. **Cheat sheet jupyter notebook** Write a Jupyter notebook with a bunch of commands to understand some of the basic ideas of the language.
2. **Echo HTTP server** Write a simple HTTP server. It will have `GET /<param>` and `POST /` endpoints. The GET will echo the header `foo`, the `param` and the query argument `bar`. POST will echo the body.
3. **Echo HTTP server with db connection** This guy does the same but logs to a database the stuff that gets passed.
4. **Authentication** A simple server that allows users to register and log in.
5. **Distributed chat app** A chat app that is deployed accross several containers. Maybe use `couchdb`.
